**How to setup**
To setup my NixOS dot files, you must move configuration.nix and the modules folder into /etc/nixos and the home-manager folder into /home/USER/.config/home-manager
To change the username you need to navigate to /etc/nixos/modules/users.nix and change the area where it says "connor" to your desired user.

**No support will be given what so ever, this repo was made so I can copy over my files, support WILL NOT be given.**
